# Godot4-PrefabsForge 
Plugin that lets you snap objects (or group of them) by selecting vertices.

### Comments
- works only with `MeshInstance3D`
- godot supported version 4.1+

### Usage:
- create `MeshInstance3D`, and create a mesh inside of it (or use custom one)
- select it and hover to one of the edges and you will see the snap point highlight
- you can click on it and go to the second mesh or you can choose another point
